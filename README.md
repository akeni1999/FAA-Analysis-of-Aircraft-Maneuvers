# FAA Analysis of Aircraft Maneuvers

### Situation

- This project utilizes helicopter simulation data to predict a specific maneuver performed. For our team, we had to make use of a wide variety of data with 100+ parameters to create a model that will accurately predict a maneuver.
- This allows for the ability to triage possible loss of control instances and identify these triggers before the loss of control occurs. By foretelling these possible issues, pilots are able to prepare for harsh conditions and be ready to mitigate risk.
  
### Task

As part of a team, I worked as a developer on the team. I was responsible for pre-processing the data and implementing the machine learning models to see which algorithm gives the highest accuracy.

### Action

- Analyzed helicopter simulation data provided by FAA to predict specific rotorcraft maneuvers.
- Led data cleaning and visualizations, processing 10000+ records in Python and Tableau for analyzing aircraft patterns.
- Integrated Physics - based approach and Principal Component Analysis with Autoencoder technique to reduce the dimensionality of the large dataset from 108 features to 35 features.
- Implemented various machine learning models like Logistic Regression, Random Forest Classifier, K Nearest Neighbor ( KNN ), Support Vector Machine ( SVM ), and Naive Bayes Algorithm to see which algorithm gave the highest accuracy.
